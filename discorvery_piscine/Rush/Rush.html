        <h1>About me - <br></h1>
        <p>
            <br> My Name is Jacob(Jake) Tanner, I’m 22 years old and a full time student at 42 Coding School Adelaide.
             Im a positive and bubbly person who enjoys chatting and learning with my peers and is always excited to start
              something new. I have experience in sales, spending a year working as a face to face fundraiser and 8 
              months as a real estate agent and while I thoroughly enjoyed working in both of these roles, I have a 
              passion for being able to create something and enjoy working on more defined and larger projects. I have
               been studying for 9 months now and feel my skills are at the level where I would be a valuable addition 
               to a team and am eager to break into the workforce again.</p>

        <h1>Early Career - <br></h1>
        <p><br>After leaving high school I spent a year and a half studying Finance and accounting 
            and working part time in a supervisor position at Coles, I eventually realized this 
            career path wasn’t a good fit for me so I started working in sales starting as a 
            supermarket fundraiser for Peter MacCallum Cancer Center and eventually transitioning 
            into door to door sales for the National Breast Cancer Foundation. During my time in
             this work I raised over $500,000 for the two charities and managed a small team raising 
             over $50,000 weekly, I was also awarded a top quality sales award for my time there
              meaning people who donated through me typically donated for a longer period of time
               than 90% of donors. I then moved into real estate where I primarily focused on 
            client acquisition and managing sales campaigns, my usual duties involved building 
            relationships with potential clients via regular contact, managing communication
             between potential purchasers and sellers and organizing the preparation of homes
              for sale. In my time there I contributed to the sale of over $8Million of real 
              estate and was directly responsible for the sale of over $3Million in just 8 months of employment.

            <p><br>
                I have always had an interest in programming, however it wasn’t until starting at 42 Adelaide that 
                I was given the proper chance to explore this interest and allow it to turn into a passion. Since 
                starting at 42 I have explored many different fields of programming primarily within the C language, 
                I have enjoyed nearly every assignment as they tackle new concepts and challenge me to learn more about
                 programming and its fundamentals. Some of the project topics I particular found fascinating and plan on 
                 furthering my knowledge on are optimized data sorting, process redirection and pipes, and web 
                 development. I also recently completed the 42 discovery piscine, a week long intensive focused
                  on teaching the students the fundamentals of web development, and have been using the skills I learnt
                   from the piscine to build this website.

                    <p><br>My job at 2k Elevations was to work money for charities by acquiring regular donors
                         and manage a small team of salesmen, primarily this was done in either a supermarket
                          or by going door to door to meet people interested in giving. This job regularly pushed 
                          me out of my comfort zone and taught me skills I never would have learnt otherwise including,
                           strong and enjoyable communication with nearly any type of person, personal and
                         interpersonal management and a strong work ethic even after a string of disappointment.<br><br></p>

                         a property for sale. In this role I further built my interpersonal skills, 
                         learning to sell in a professional environment and dealing with far fewer but much 
                         larger sales, teaching me the importance of consistency and persistence when working 
                         with clients. While managing longer form campaigns I further developed my organizational skills as this role required making sure tasks were completed on time 
                        and jobs were coordinated to be done in the most efficient way.<br><br></p>

                    <p><br>I spent most my time at Coles working as a service supervisor, 
                        which mostly had me working the registers and and a few extra responsibilities 
                        that had been delegated to me. Throughout my time there I was trained in several 
                        different departments, briefly worked as the second in command(2IC) for the service 
                        department and was even given the responsibility of brining Coles online to our store. 
                        Whilst not the most glamorous role I am thankful for my time there as it taught me 
                        valuable skills at a young age, especially when working as 2IC during the height of covid 
                        panic. I learnt the value of reassurance when dealing with difficult customers, managing overworked 
                        staff and prioritizing jobs appropriately for any given situation.<br><br></p>

                                <p><br>This project introduced me to optimized data sorting, the aim is to take a stack as an input, and using only rotate commands, push commands and one other stack, organize it in the most efficient way possible. I really enjoyed this assignment as it I love to take code I’ve written and tinker with it in ways to make it better. I’m particularly proud of this assignment as I made a point of not using any external resources or guides when making this and not settling until it got the maximum scores 42 gives for this assignment (100numbers < 700moves, 500numbers < 5500moves) and therefore I think you would be hard pressed to find a similar sorting code from other students.<br><br></p>

                                <p><br>This assignment is to introduce students to pipes and redirection, the aim is to create a program that imitates the shell pipe ‘|’ command. I found the concept of this assignment particularly confusing as prior to this I had very little experience with redirection, however with time and research I managed to get a good grasp on how pipes work and how piping outputs into other programs can be useful.<br><br></p>

                                <p><br>This was a pretty fun assignment to do, the goal was to create a program that displays a fractal on a window that can be adjusted and changed based on key and mouse inputs. This was fun to learn as it was my first introduction into using windows and using hooks to manipulate them and the images on the screen. I really enjoyed learning about how colors and bit manipulation work within programs and had a lot of fun coming up with creative ways to change the colors.<br><br></p>

I built this without the use of any extra libraries or website builders and included elements of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, all of which I had no experience with less than a week ago. I have found working on this website to be lots of fun, I really enjoyed learning how different parts of a website interact with each other and ways to tinker with the code to make it smoother or work better and would love to work in Web Development if given the chance.<br><br></p>
